### About the App

This application provides a comprehensive analysis of uploaded datasets using advanced statistical techniques, specifically linear regression. Users can upload their datasets in CSV or Excel formats and analyze correlations and feature impacts on the target variable.

#### Features:

1. **File Upload**:
   - Users can upload their datasets in CSV or Excel formats.

2. **Data Preview**:
   - After uploading, a preview of the dataset is displayed, along with its shape (number of rows and columns).

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Users can select two numeric variables to analyze their correlation. The app provides a correlation coefficient and indicates whether the relationship is positive, negative, or non-existent.

4. **Summary Statistics**:
   - A summary of the dataset is displayed, providing key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.

5. **Top Winning Ads**:
   - The app utilizes a custom selector module (`winningadselector`) to display the top 10 winning ads based on a predefined metric.

6. **Data Filtering**:
   - Users can filter the dataset based on unique values in a selected column to focus analysis on specific subsets of data.

7. **Dynamic Plotting**:
   - Users can select x-axis and y-axis variables to generate dynamic line plots for visual analysis.

8. **Linear Regression Analysis**:
   - Users can select a target variable and one or more features to run a linear regression analysis. The app provides coefficients, p-values, and standard errors for each feature to assess their statistical significance.

9. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - The app performs hypothesis testing for the regression coefficients, offering insights into their significance and influence on the target variable.
